--- abstract

Building and managing highly dynamic and heterogenous distributed systems can prove to be quite challenging due to the great complexity and scale of such environments.
This documents specifies a Generic Framework for Building Dynamic and Scalable Systems (GFDS), which composes a reference architecture and execution model for developing and managing these systems while providing high level abstractions to users.

... When dealing with such systems one must be , such as handling the inter-connection of nodes, tolerating transient faults, or assuring the security of the different participants, which proves the extreme complexity of administrating and validating such systems.
