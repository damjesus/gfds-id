  A Generic Framework for Building Dynamic and Scalable Systems (GFDS)
                        draft-tardis-gfds-latest

Abstract

   Building and managing highly dynamic and heterogenous distributed
   systems can prove to be quite challenging due to the great complexity
   and scale of such environments.  This documents specifies a Generic
   Framework for Building Dynamic and Scalable Systems (GFDS), which
   composes a reference architecture and execution model for developing
   and managing these systems while providing high level abstractions to
   users.

1.  Introduction

   ... When dealing with such systems one must be , such as handling the
   inter-connection of nodes, tolerating transient faults, or assuring
   the security of the different participants, which proves the extreme
   complexity of administrating and validating such systems.
